# SMART IRRIGATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND IOT

### Abstract:
The farm can be technologized with electronic innovation that constantly screens the states of crops, soil, and condition so the crops could be given watering and shed as required. The entirety of this can be controlled and observed online with the utilization of IoT and human-like intelligence can be added to it by training our model with our proposed algorithm. We will make a device that will be interfaced with a water pump and a shed to protect the garden from light and rain, controlled by a single-channel relay. The water siphon and shed are consequently controlled dependent on the estimations of the different natural elements like temperature, moistness, soil dampness, and light power which we can quantify through sensors like Temperature and Humidity sensor (DHT-11), Moisture sensor and LDR Light sensor. Through our research work, we will try to make the model intelligent by storing the previous scanned values in the database and doing the pre-perception based on historic values stored in the learning phase of the working model. We will be using a linear regression algorithm to train our model.
